# Food4Foodies

Increase the efficiency of your kitchen by bundling your recipe search, grocery list and weekly plan all in one place! Why have multiple tabs open searching recipes, making your seemingly endless list and still have to transfer that all in to a calendar? Gathering some of our favorite features from similar apps and presenting them to you with our own flavor.

## Usage
- Search an enormous database of recipes from Spoonacular
- Find your favorites, and save them to your profile
- Or simply crave it for some time during the week by adding it to your calendar and watch the grocery list assemble itself.

Here the app begins, you can log in with Username: Test || Password: 123

## Contribution & Technologies
With the help of [Sonia Davila]( https://github.com/sd902h), and technologies such as Node, React, and Material-ui, we were able to develop the early stages of this useful application. Currently just a learning project, but with time possible updates. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns for me, [Guillermo Garcia Jr.](https://guillermo1213.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/), you can find my portfolio by clicking on my name. Thanks for taking the time to readme! :kissing_heart:
